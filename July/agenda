Next orders of business:
-Repeat in Q&A format and classification task
-Try: "translate from English into Spanish" with 1000s sentences and same for "English into German", and then see if you have some isometry
-Classification task: give features and model predicts animal; then ablate PCs to see if this leads to ignorance of feature (e.g. classifies horse features where "mane" is dropped as dog)
-Repeat last token work with interpolation between manifold centroids and same for word manifolds
-Try ablating PCs of the manifold (i.e. drop a dimension)


For translation:
take same prompts, pass half into inference iwth english ot spanish system prompt and the other half english to german. make sure to mark teh concepts as dog into spanish and dog into german to get two manifolds. How are these manifolds similar? Just translated along a PC (would that!)?


####
Papers: train meta-meta-SAE on same data as Nanda paper; see if you keep getting more atomic features


####
Speculative: What happens when you prompt an LLM during inference to learn a new language of your syntactical design? How are the components of this synthetic simple language represented? Or, simpler, how differently are languages represented? Is it just some orthogonal vector indicating language or does syntax mess up more?

Concerns about current experiments:
-artificial labelling of concepts pre-constrain shwo we interpret representations
-the user prompt is two sentences but all prompts.json are one.
-should we pass system prompt through when we define the manifolds as well?
-since we filter prompts.json for wordToken.py, we end up with ~half the number of prompts for manifold generation as we have for lastToken.py
-how do we deal with the system/padding tokens we we generate the manifold

####
Pre-discarded ideas:
-Repeat wordToken for multi-word perturbations
